## General Note

For the purpose of greater clarity within this tutorial, we always indicate the package we take a function from.
In general, creating a package in R in the way suggested by this workshop relies on two packages you should install on your local machine: `devtools` and `usethis`.
Ensure that these two packages are installed on your machine!

```{r}
## check whether the packages are already installed on your machine:
# installed.packages()
## if necessary, install the packages on your machine:
# install.packages(c("devtools", "usethis"))
```

Please note that creating a package will require to open a new `Project`.
We can therefore not provide a markdown sheet that allows you to run the code chunks in the exercise sheet.
In the solutions included, the required code snippets are therefore included as comments (only exception is the basic function we provide below).
Code Chunk you can copy in your `Project` are tagged with #, explanatory comments are tagged with ##.

## 1. Open a template package

Create a New Project for our package in `RStudio`.

Once our package template is created, go ahead and explore it!

```{r}
## In order to create a package, perform the following steps:
##    "File", "New Project", "New Directory", "R-Package"
##     Set Name, Set Sub-directory

```

## 2. Add a function to your package

Create new function "basic_summary" in the package we created!

```{r}
# usethis::use_r("basic_summary")
```

Insert the following function into the newly created `.R` file:

```{r}
## function that returns:
## 1. box plot and histogram of the distribution of the input
basic_summary <- function(x){
  par(mrow=c (1, 1))
  boxplot(x)
  par(mrow=c (1, 1))
  ## 2. a data frame with a basic statistical description of the input
  data.frame(
    min = min(x),
    max = max(x),
    med = median(x),
    mean = mean(x)
  )
}
```

## 3. Update your package structure

Connect our function with the rest of our package structure, click on `Code`,then on `Insert Roxygen Skeleton`.

![Screenshot of Insert Roxygen Skeleton](creating-packages-exercises_files/Screenshot_Insert_Roxygen_Skeleton.png)

Correctly filled out, the `ROXYGEN` comments allow our helper functions to update information stored in namespace and man (manual).
(Note: In order to take full advantage of `ROXYGEN` support, we delete the pre-existing `NAMESPACE`-file.)

```{r}
## Cheat-Sheet ROXYGEN Attributes:
## use "Code", "Insert Roxygen Skeleton"
## Title of the function w/ @title
## Description of the function purpose with @description
## Documenting the function arguments/parameters with @param
## Specifying it for export with @export
## If it requires external packages, reference the package or specific package functions with @import and @importFrom
## What does the function return with @return
```

```{r}
## delete pre-existing "NAMESPACE"-file

## Fill the ROXYGEN template in the following (very basic) way:
#' basic_summary
#' @param x A numeric vector
#' @description Purpose of the function: Grasp unfamiliar numeric data sets
#' @return a first summary of statistic description of a numeric vector
#' @export basic_summary
```

Next, you can implement these `ROXYGEN` inputs into our package structure!

```{r}
# devtools::document()
```

Make sure our file is correctly saved and stored in our package´s `R`-folder!

```{r}
### insert GIF of going to R-folder and seeing file created called basic_summary.R
```

Congrats, you created your first function within your own R-Package!

## 4. Check your work

Next, let´s make extra sure this worked as intended by clearing your environment and (re-)loading all functions from your package.

```{r}
## When it comes to interacting with the functions in our package, let´s establish good habits early on.
## Please start by clearing objects from your environment and use the following code load them again:
# devtools::load_all()
```

Once we loaded all functions from our package again, we are ready to actually test them.

For this, again we want to establish good practices from day one on!

Please make sure to have a complete formal check performed by using package testing code.

(Note: Usually, we will want to add further tests (using `usethis::use_testthat()`) that ensure our function works in the specific way we intended.
Given the limited time we have at our hands, we cannot cover this part in this workshop unfortunately)

```{r}
# devtools::check()
## Note: This checks only for a standardized set of formal errors
```

Have you received warning or error messages?
Don´t worry, that is completely normal - at any stage of our package creation workflow and in fact especially at this stage.
What matters is: Do you understand the output your machine provides?
Can you check and correct the issues?
Once we solved the problems, check re-load and check your package again.

```{r}
## take care of license issue:
#"usethis::use_mit_license()"
## depending on whether we deleted the "hello_world" function, we might get an error message
## rerun the check:
# devtools::check()
```

![Screenshot of Check Output without Errors and Warnings](creating-packages-exercises_files/Screenshot_Check.png)

Install and load our package, then test it with the height variable from the star_wars data set!

### Bonus Question 1: load_all()

Can you spot a difference from using load_all() for the functions in our package and creating a function in a regular R-Studio session?

```{r}
## ANSWER: The loaded functions from "load_all()" do not appear in the global environment 
```

### Bonus Question 2: Function Workability

Any idea why we asked you to test our package on the height variable instead of the species variable?

```{r}
## Our function can only deal with numeric input, not with strings. Different input will probably result in an error.
## This is where we would specify input problems or limitations of our function with test() functions to ease the pain during future use of our packages! 
```

### Bonus Task 1: Help with functions

Ask `RStudio` for help on our function!

### Bonus Task 2: Github Repository

Load our package into your Github Repository!
