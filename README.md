# Creating packages with R


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the state of the art way to write your own packages in R. Yes, this is very cool. Writing packages is a way to save massive amounts of time. In this session we will make plausible why it makes sense to write own packages and optionally share them with others. In addition, we will show you how to use ´devtools´ and the ´usethis´ package in order to develop packages easily. Finally, we will go with you trough the whole process of developing a tiny example package in R.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with knowledge why it makes sense to write packages, (2) show you key functions of devtools and usethis in order to write small packages easily (3) and provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
