# Creating packages with R


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the state of the art way to write your own packages in R. Yes, this is very cool. Writing packages (stopped here FP) is one of the core steps in the data science workflow. dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges, including the manipulation of datasets and variables. 

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the dplyr package and data wrangling workflow, (2) show you the three key verbs of the pacakge, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
