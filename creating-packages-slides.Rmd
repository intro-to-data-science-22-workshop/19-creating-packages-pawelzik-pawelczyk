# What is a package?

Let us ask some experts, namely Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan in [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html):

> Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.

--

Put it very simple: packages are a bundle of **functions**. However, they offer us more than that e.g. adding function **descriptions**, **datasets** or even new **data-types**.

<!-- 
- Pipes (you already know that âœ…)
- User-generated functions
- Functional programming with `purrr` -->

--

We will now learn the basics of creating our own packages with R. We will go along the following outline:

- What was a function again?
- Why do we need packages?
- **How do we build packages?**


---
# Detour: Functions
.pull-left[
Why functions? Because they have the potential to save enormous amount of time and therefore gives us more time to think about more substantial questions. A function usually consists of:

- A function **name** that informas the user about the function's purpose
- **ARGUMENTS** to the function that controlling the output of a function
- **BODY** that represents all the code used inside
- **return value**: what should the function return?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
name <- function(ARGUMENTS) {
    BODY
    return(VALUE)
  }
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Let's look briefly at an example function - one that coverts any value to it's squared value.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sq <- function(x) {
  stopifnot("input must be numeric" = is.numeric(x))
  x_squared <- x^2
  return(x_squared)
}

```
]

# Creating packages

### Why creating packages?

People usually build packages to **save time**. For instance, some institutions have a _corporate identity_, so they always use charts in _specific colours_ and often make use of their _logo_ somewhere. All those things could also be part of a package.

In general, the pro-arguments are very analogue to the ones for using functions but:

- We can to **reuse** the functions

- **Share workflows** and empower yourself AND others (descriptions becoming crucial here!)

- Packages make your work easier, faster and more reproducible. R packages let you share these functions or reuse them another time 

<!--: Let's assume you want to get the clean text data from parliamentary speeches to run a NLP model. Instead of applying multiple steps on each document, e.g. downloading the stenographic reports, rename the documents manually and retrieve the relevant text data from pdf we build a function that runs all these steps on each document automatically and outputs us a clean data frame with all relevant variables such as text, speaker etc. Easy to see the advantage of the function timewise. -->

<!-- Two weeks later we want to run a **similar task** on parliamentary speeches from another country... It would be obvious to **reuse functions** from last time and/or **adjust some of the functions** we already used. We should write a package! -->

# Creating packages
### The anatomy of a package

* **Metadata** via the `DESCRIPTION`, including the name of our package, description of the package, the version of the package, and any package dependencies but also the authors' name

--

* **Source code** via `.R` files, that live in the `R/` directory

--

* Special `roxygen` comments inside the `.R` files that describe how the function operates and its arguments, dependencies, and other metadata

--

* The **namespace** for the _exported functions_ we have written, and the _imported functions_ we bring in 

--

* Tests that confirm our function "works as intended"  

--

* Other things (installed files, compiled code, data, tutorials, vignettes)

---

# Creating packages

### Writing packages using packages

* [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/):  

> The aim of devtools is to make package development easier by providing R functions that simplify and expedite common tasks.

--

* [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/)  

> usethis is a workflow package: it automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development, both for R packages and non-package projects.

# Relevant commands: _create_package()_
### Create a blank package

Can call `usethis::create_package()` or use the RStudio GUI.

# Relevant commands: _use_r()_

Where do we want to define our function? We want to save it in an `.R` file in our `R/` subdirectory folder of our package (we saw this above already). For beginners it is recommended to create a new `.R` file for each function of our package and name the file similar to the function. More advanced user begin to group related functions together. In order to save our first function we can simply use the following syntax:

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_r("sq")

```

# Relevant commands: _use_r()_

Where do we want to define our function? We want to save it in an `.R` file in our `R/` subdirectory folder of our package (we saw this above already). For beginners it is recommended to create a new `.R` file for each function of our package and name the file similar to the function. More advanced user begin to group related functions together. In order to save our first function we can simply use the following syntax:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_r("sq")

```


Note: After executing the `use_r()` command we can use our function although it is not defined in our global environment. We already get some package-vibes here, right? 
Also, put **only** the definition of our new function (in this case`sq()`) into the `R/sq.R` file and save it. Otherwise one can easily run into problems.

---

# Relevant commands: _load_all()_

In order to experiment with our created package we can use `devtools::load_all()`.

--

To keep it simple: `devtools::load_all()` loads our package. It roughly simulates what happens when a package is installed and loaded with `library()`. `load_all()` will make our function available, although it does not appear in our global environment.

--

After loading the package it is recommended to confirm that the minimal function is working.


# Relevant commands: _check()_

How can we ensure that our example function `sq()` works? `devtools::check()` offers an easy solution for that. It automatically checks the package using all known best practices.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::check()
```

--

After running a lot of checks the `check`<sup>1</sup> function gives us a summary at the end that tells us how many errors, warnings or notes are returned.

.footnote[<sup>1</sup> **Good practice:** It's important to run this frequently, as you would rather have small moments of friction to fix, rather than doing it much later and having an overwhelming amount of changes to make.]


---
# Relevant commands: _use_mit_license()_

After the first `check()` we would at least get one warning: the **license is missing**.

Since software licensing is a rather complicated field because it lies at the intersection between programming and law, we will simplify this part. The license we give indicates how authors want their code to be treated.

In our example we will go for the `use_mit_license()`. But if you're interested in this topic we will link you a good resource and you can read more about it:

<!--### Edit description Shall I do this?  --- -->

# Relevant commands: _document()_

A big advantage of packages and the functions that come along is the possibility to call the help `?` function. Let's add useful documentation around our package and our function `sq()`. For doing so, we need a special R documentation file, `man/sq.Rd`<sup>2</sup>.

.footnote[<sup>2</sup> Note: man stands for manual.]

For adding our documentation to the package we open `R/sq.R` in the source editor and we put our cursor somewhere in the `sq.R` function definition. We than can click in RStudio _Code > Insert roxygen skeleton_. This will add special comments (a template) that begins each line with `#'`. Now we can easily type in the relevant description of our function `sq`.

After inserting all the documentation we want to specify we need to save this roxygen comments into `man/sq.Rd`. We can do so using `devtools::document()`.

--

Do we want to add the specifications of the roxygen skeleton such as title, description etc?
